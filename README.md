# bexis_traits

developing a trait data framework for use in the Biodiversity Exploratories

Purpose of this project: Develop a data template for trait data measured on or collected for animals,

which is applicable across various taxonomic groups.

## Reference lists

References are saved in BibTex files for easy import in Latex, RMarkdown or EndNote. The reference style is following the BibTex style with costum labels for comfortable citation within the markdown document. Lables have to be unique and consist of the first author with the year of publication (e.g. Birkhofer2017). If multiple publications by one author in the same year are included, the journal's abbreviation is added (e.g. Birkhofer2015AGEE and Birkhofer2015Ecography).

Citations in the text are indicated by @Birkhofer2017 or by -@Birkhofer2017 for Author (Year) style.
