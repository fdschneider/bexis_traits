# bexis_traits

developing a trait data framework for use in the Biodiversity Exploratories

Purpose of this project: Develop a data template for trait data measured on or collected for animals, which is applicable across various taxonomic groups.

Four subprojects have branched out from this repository:

- https://github.com/EcologicalTraitData/ETS
- https://github.com/EcologicalTraitData/traitdataform
- https://github.com/EcologicalTraitData/TraitDataList
- and the actual Methods paper, which is being developed within this original repositories subdirectory: [manuscript](https://github.com/fdschneider/bexis_traits/tree/master/manuscript)

Each sub-project has an own issues page, where tasks are developed and discussed.
