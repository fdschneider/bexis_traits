# Introduction

## The concept of functional traits in biodiversity research

Functional traits are phenotypic characteristics that are related to the fitness and performance of an organism. 

Traits can be measurements of morphology of animals or plants, life-history traits such as reproductive strategies, physiological traits including metabolism and photosynthetic activity, feeding traits, biochemical and isotopic compounds, as well as environmental traits. 

The source of trait data can be single or repeated direct measurements and derivatives thereof, more or less specific literature values or estimations from designated experts. 

Some studies propose a differentiation of effect traits and response traits (or  performace and fitness traits), which may be depending on the research question. 

Reflecting this wide range of measures and approaches, traits are assessed with multiple questions in mind. 

at individual scale: evolution of adaptive traits, intraspecific variation, at species scale: Morphology and phylogeny, ecological function and trophic role, biotic interactions. 
at ecosystem scale: functional composition of communities, community weighted means and variance, ecosystem service provisioning. 
at global spatial and temporal scale: global spectrum of form and function, biogeography, palaeoecology

A focus on functional traits allows to describe the role of a species in an ecosystem or its ability to persist under certain environmental conditions. 

Traits help in bridging individual level behaviour and physiology into processes at the ecosystem scale.

traits help to identify economic strategies of organisms, beyond taxonomy

## Common structure of trait datasets

Traitdata have been standardised into databases. Most prominently, plant traits from many different sources have been collated into the quickly growing TRY databse. TRY combines traitdata from other published databases and individually owned datasets and provides an extended access management and data query services. Other more specialised databases for plant traits exist, for instance for root measurements. 

In the animal kingdom, a wealth of traitdatabases has been created that covers different organism groups or interaction types or ecosystems. 
(table of existing databases? name, url, focus, number of records, openness of data, maintained by)

All databases come with their own structure, which reflects the research questions of the research initiatives and their organismal focus. 

Today, several biodiversity data intitiatives are striving for a global integration of ecological and biological information and develop universal data frameworks for trait data. The EOL TraitBank for instance is the most general framework to date (Parr et al 2015). 

### minimal definition of trait-datasets 

As a minimum consensus, trait datasets may be defined as follows: 
A trait-dataset contains measurements or facts (i.e. measurement values) about phenotypic characteristics of fitness or performance (i.e. measurement types, or traits) assigned to an entity of a biological taxon (i.e. a species or higher taxon). The entity or observation (i.e. the occurence) to which the reported measurement or fact apllies may differ in resolution -- depending on the scientific question -- and could be a subsample or bodypart, an individual specimen, an entire species or higher-level taxon. 

### standardised reference to taxon and trait definitions 

To obtain digitized datasets being comparable, much effort has gone into the development of precise definitions and standardised reference lists of taxon names and trait definitions.

Relevant for all domains of biodiversity data, authors and data managers must provide compatibility to other datasets by referencing their data to published taxonomic ontologies, which exist for all organism groups and many regions of the world (examples!). Widest coverage today may be found in the GBIF backbone taxonomy or ... . This may be acheived by referencing an observation to a unique identifier (which can be either alpha-numeric or full taxon name, including author and date of first description, or a unambiguous Unique Resource Identifier, URI, which refers to a precisely defined term in a published ontology) and provide the information to which ontology the taxon names refer to in the metadata.

Similarly motivated, traits for target organism groups and ecosystems have been categorized and defined in thesauri  (e.g., Plant Trait Ontology [20] or Vertebrate Trait Ontology [28]) or ontologies (morphometrics?), which also provide unique identifiers for referencing along with more or less precise definitions of the body measures, morphometric landmarks, categorical traits or environmental conditions, for instance. Ideally, these thesauri also define a target measurement unit or constrain factor levels. Multiple approaches have spawned around the initialisation of trait databases, most advanced certainly for plant traits in the TRY database and its reference Thesaurus of Plant characteristics (TOP).  

Traits must not only be defined in terms of their interpretation, but ideally also be standardised in terms of numerical units and, evene more important, the use of factor levels. This is challenging given the range of data types that fall within datasets of functional traits: numerical values represent measurements of length, volumes, ratios, rates or timespans. integer values may apply to count data (e.g. eggs per clutch). binary data (encoded as 0 or 1) or logical data (coded as TRUE or FALSE) may apply to qualitative traits such as ... . Many traits are categorical and allow for a constrained set of factor levels, such as ... () or unconstrained entries such as color. Some traits take character strings of descriptions. Finally there are specific formats of multivariate trait values (e.g. x.y.z coordinates of a landmark measured in 3D space or relative abundance of chain-lengths in biochemical compounds).
To achieve comparability of traits across taxonomic groups, some trait standards suggest a hierarchical classification or a relational tree of functional traits (e.g. TOP or T-SITA). This links traits of similar meaning and allow cross-taxon comparative studies.  
Thus, a trait thesaurus should assign trait names with A) a unique definition and B) an expected format of measured values or reported facts, and might additionally provide C) a hierarchical or tree-based classification of traits. 

Initiatives to standardise traits into consensus terminology are usually formed around a research question, or methodology, or organism group and therefore vary in the traits that they consider important. To make trait measurements truly comparable, it requires precise definitions of traits, including the expected numerical or categorical resolution and measurement units. These reference definitions are currently being published in methodological handbooks (Moretti et al , ) or lists of accepted traits (databases), or an online ontology or thesaurus (TOP, T-Sita, ). The latter is the only option that enables direct linking to a term via a URI.
Some trait glossaries extend into (machine readable) ontologies by providing a hierarchical or tree-based classification of traits (TOP, Moretti et al) . These systematic approaches to traits will be very useful for comparing similar traits measured in different taxa at higher hierarchical levels. The benefit of such classifications will increase if API services provide a systematic way to extract the higher-level trait hierarchies. 
To our knowledge, none of the trait initiatives today provides a fully open API that would allow extracting machine readable definitions and terms via software tools. To harmonize trait data across databases, future trait standard initiatives should provide this functionality.  


### traitdata formats 

Such trait-datasets take different formats. For instance, if trait data have been collated at the species level from different literature sources or from expert knowledge, they usually are reported in a species $\times$ trait matrix format, with a column of trait values for each trait recorded and a row for each species (or taxon) for which data were available. This format is usually reporting missing data as NA. It may store additional information (e.g. on variation of means or literature source) in secondary colums. The matrix format is widely used for the production of lookup-tables at the species level, which for instance may be used for the calculation of community weighted means or functional diversity metrics at the community level (Refs). Also, missing information about the behaviour and functional role of species of little ecological record may be inferred from these tables (Refs).  
For investigations of within species variation of traits, traits would be recorded per observation, i.e. each individual specimen would be recorded in a row, with the traits measured on it stored in columns. Those data are common in investigations of evolutionary trade-offs and trait correlation, or of intra-specific variation and sexual dimorphism.   

Computationally most effective and allowing for highest flexibility is the storage of traitdata in long-table formats, where each row is reserved for a single measurement or fact, referenced to a single observation (i.e. a specimen or taxon) and a trait definition. This allows for repeated measurements, even on a single individual. Also, multivariate trait measurements can be recorded in this format by linking multiple rows via a unique measurement ID. 
The latter format is therefore providing the highest resolution and ideal for storing raw data of trait measurements in huge databases and link them via the respective unique identifiers to additional information, such as location or taxonomy.  

<!-- additional information -->

In addition to the minimal definition above, trait-datasets may come with a variety of additional information. The long-table format is ideal for storing this metadata-information on the measurement level. Additional information on the occurence (i.e. the specimen where the trait was measured), the measurement method or accuracy, could be referenced in other sheets of a databse and linked via IDs. The matrix or table format would have to keep this information referenced in metadata or linked datasets. 

(We conceptualize trait-datasets to  not include information about a species' interaction partners/associations of an organism, since they are -- to our understanding -- not within the scope of functional traits. However, such network data may be of interest to be combined with trait data. )

### additional detail on measurement or fact

Data resolution differs and researchers might report aggregated species averages or replicates of individual measurements. A universally applicable framework needs to fall back to the smallest unit, i,e. the single measurement (Kattge  et al 2011), and allow multiple measurements of a single trait for a single species at a single site (i.e. one observation). Indeed this resolution is necessary for assessing intra-specific trait variation, or even variation of traits of a single specimen (e.g. size of leaves of a single tree).  In case of aggregated measurements, however, researchers might record the average and the dispersal, and also keep information about the statistical method of a average record and the dispersal metric (e.g. variance or range) as well as the number of individuals aggregated. Having this information available, would allow compiling weighted averages of species traits by combining data of  different resolution.

In the case of measured data, the method and accuracy of measurement, the methods of sampling or preservation of the specimen, as well as the person measuring, would be recorded to assess any methodological bias.
The measurements most likely were taken under certain natural or artificial environmental conditions, that might also be recorded along with the trait data. A protocoll of measurement might be referred to. 

In case of datasets collating information from other sources, literature would be referenced or an expert name reported. For museum specimens or private collections, the unique identifier of the museum collection would link the measurement to a real physical object.

(Many of the information described in the previous two section are defined in the [Darwin Core Extension Measurement or Fact](). )

#### additional information on observation context /occurence level information

The entity at which the measurement was obtained or to which it refers to may be further detailled: Some traits are recorded as species or population level averages, such as functional guild assignment or average longevity. In that case, the taxon rank to which the measurement applies needs to be documented. 
Similarly, measurements might resolve to lower than species level, to subspecies, or even sub-groups of a single species, like a sex, caste, or morphotype. 

specimenID  / occurenceID

Trait data may be recorded from specimens which developed in a particular spatial and climatic context, or cultivated under (semi-)controlled conditions. A dataset should report these details.  

Therefore, georeference, altitude and date of sampling would be recorded to capture and investigate climate and location as a source of trait variation. A unique location identifier may link the observation to an experimental context or dataset-specific reference table or a global database of locations. To add ecological context, the habitat type where the specimen was observed could be classified.

(Most of the information described in the last two sections are subsumized under the [Occurence Extension of the Darwin Core](http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Occurrence#Occurrence), and may also be referenced into an external database via a unique Occurence identifier. ) 

### information on attribution and permissions to use

Finally, an own class of information might apply to the entire trait-dataset, which classifies them as metadata. Since trait data are of great use for synthesis studies, information about how the data may be distributed, re-used and attributed to are of particular importance for  trait datasets. Most researchers encourage re-use of their published datasets while making sure they are sufficiently credited. The use of permissive licenses for traitdata publications, such as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or Public Domain release, has been established as the gold standard.

## Towards a traitdata standard 

In this paper, we propose a universal scheme of defined column names and data structure that captures the different degrees of resolution and measurement detail for multiple use cases of trait data. 

Existing initiatives for standardising data are focused on a constrained organism group, ecosystem type or region and compile data in own centralised databases. Among the different  approaches, the TRY database for plant characteristics is certainly the one with highest coverage. The most inclusive trait database to date has been created in the framework of the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) with TraitBank (Parr et al 2015). With the framework presented here, we aim for compatibility with those standards.

However, while TraitBank and TRY are centralised infrastructures, we want to facilitate the use of a standard format of trait data by suggessting a  flexible formatting scheme that can be applied in multiple contexts, for instance of a taxon-specific database or in user-side compilations of trait data from different sources. 

For standardisation and comparability of traitdata across datasets, conventions on trait definitions and taxon names are inevitable. We consider the fact that authors have their own schemes for standardisation and may contribute to different communities by allowing for a double record of standardised and user-specific entries (TRY, Kattge et al ).  

The trait-dataset may be linked to supporting information (e.g. on the occurence, the methodology, the original source, the sampling event or location) on the metadata level or in attached data tables, e.g. in the form of a Darwin Core Archive, or into external databases via URIs. For this interlinkage with other datasets, columns are reserved for unique identifiers (e.g. linking measurements to location, collections, literature) that refer to a dataset specific or globally defined ID. 

In the subsequent sections we propose a set of columns that compose a traitdataset, starting with the ones required for our minimal definition of trait-datasets proposed above and continuing with columns that add information on the level of the occurence, the measurement or fact, and the entire record.  The column names are, wherever possible, based on the terms of the Darwin Core Standard (DWC). See table 2 for a full description of the column names and the reference URI. 

#### minimal content of a trait-dataset

For the minimal definition of trait-datasets, the central content of a row is the reported measurement or fact for a single observation, which is composed of a value (`measurementValue`) and -- for numeric values -- a standard unit (`measurementUnit`).

The key identifier columns are relating the measurement or fact to a taxon via globally accepted identifiers. To provide an unambiguous reference which is easy to read for researchers and for software, this identifier is provided in the form of an unambiguous taxon name (`scientificName` plus the optional `taxonRank` and `kingdom`) as well as a machine readable ID (`taxonID`). 

To link the measurement or fact to a clear trait definition, a unique identifier  links each row to a trait name defined by a given lookup-table (`measurementType`) and a machine readable trait ID (`traitID`). 

A unique identifier links the row to a single specimen or occurence (`occurenceID`), which can be described with further detail in a separate data table or the same table using the columns provided in the occurence extension detailled below. This identifier is usually dataset-specific and can be defined by the author. Some data-types may use global identifiers for occurence data, e.g. a GBIF URI or a museum collection code that is publicly available. 

Similarly, each single measurement (i.e. each row of the dataset, except for multivariate traitdata; see below) is labelled by a unique identifier (`measurementID`) and receives further detail in a linked dataset or in the same dataset using the columns provided by the measurement or fact Extension. 

To ensure compatibility at the side of the data provider and for quality checking the data table ought to keep the original names and values as used by the data provider in columns appending the suffix `_original` (i.e. `scientificName`, `measurementType`, `measurementValue`, `measurementUnit`,  `measurementID`, `occurenceID`). 

Additionally, metadata  should contain information about the authorship and ownership of the data and the terms of use. 

In the following paragraphs, we specify these facets of trait-datasets and provide a suite of extended column definitions that capture the important aspects of the various types of trait-data. 

(Table showing example of minimal data)

#### globally unique identifier of a measurement

To ensure compatibility of datasets of different origin, we propose to use a cryptographic hash function for the generation of a globally unique identifier of each measurement (`measurementID`). Cryptographic hash functions compile strings of variable content length into a bit string of fixed size. This string can be used to compare data and check for duplicates across multiple datasets. The method we propose is to collate a comma separated string of all original (i.e. user provided, labelled with  `_original`) data columnsand parse them using the SHA1 algorithm. The rationale of using the user-specific columns only is that those data are not changing even if a measurement has been reformatted for a different context.  We provide a script to create the measurementID as well as a automated workflow in the R package described below. 

#### global taxonomy standards

The entries provided in the fields `scientificName` and `taxonID` are supposed to refer to an accepted and published taxonomic ontology. Any synonyms should be mapped to the accepted scientific names. The most complete taxonomic terminology service that is reachable through an API and software tools is the GBIF backbone taxonomy. The function `getGbifTaxonomy()` provided within the R package helps extracting the acceptes species names and taxon IDs for a given vector of user provided species names. The function also extracts a  record of the kingdom (in column `kingdom`) to avoid misinterpretation of taxonomic homonyms. It also keeps a record of the taxon rank (in column `taxonRank`) for filtering purposes for traits recorded at the family or genus level. This information can be used for trait inferrence of higher taxonomic resolution using hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (Shan et al 2012, Schrodt et al 2015).


#### towards globally unique identifiers for traits

More difficult than the taxonomic reference is the standardised reference to defined functional traits, due to a lack of URIs or APIs (see above). Eventually, the field  `measurementTypeID` should refer to globally unique identifiers for a well defined measurement methodology. However, many measurements that qualify as traits following the definition above are motivated by the particular research question and demand a specific measurement methodology. Some trait data are drawn from a wide literature body with different approaches of reporting for instance body lengths or ecological information. 
Therefore, if no published trait list is available that can be referrenced via globally unique URIs or DOIs, traitdatasets should be accompanied by a dataset-specific glossary of traits. This should at minimum provide a human readable trait name and a unique (alphanumeric) identifier as well as a verbal definition and the accepted factor levels (for categorical data) and expected units (for numerical data).

- life-history traits
- Morphometric traits

#### Extension on measurement or fact

As a high-level discrimination of the source of the measurement or fact, the column `basisOfRecord` takes an entry about the type of trait data recorded: Were they taken by own measurement (distinguish "LivingSpecimen", "PreservedSpecimen", "FossilSpecimen") or taken from literature ("literatureData"), from an existing trait database ("traitDatabase"), or is it expert knowledge ("expertKnowledge"). It is highly recommended to provide further detail about the source in the column `basisOfRecordDetails`. 

For data not obtained from own measurement, the field `reference` provides a precise reference to the source of data. This should quote the key, book, or  database for literature data. For museum specimens, this should report the name of the collection (potentially provide an URI). If expert knowledge, this should name the authority. If trait database, provide reference to the original publication, DOI or URL of the trait-database.

To record potential sources of noise or bias, the methods and procedures of fixation and preservation of the specimen (column `preparations`), method of measurement (`measurementMethod`), the person conducting the measurement (`measurementDeterminedBy`), the date at which the measurement was obtained (`measurementDeterminedDate`) are recorded. 

One issue of transparency of data is that the degree of taxonomic resolution at the time of observation of the specimen might be unclear. For instance, for literature data, the  data source might report trait values on the family or genus level, but the data author infers and reports the trait data at species level (e.g. if the entire genus reportedly shares the same trait value).

For some measured values, authors would report aggregate data of repeated measurements or pooled measurements, e.g. by weighing a multiple individuals simultaneously and calculating an average. In these cases, recording the number of individuals (`individualCount`) along with a dispersion measure (e.g. variance or standard deviation, `dispersion`) or range of values (e.g. min and max of values observed in the field `measurementValueMin`, `measurementValueMax`) is adviced. The field `statisticalMethod` names the method for data aggregation (e.g. mean or median) or averaging as well as the variation or range.

#### Extension on observation context (occurence)

This category of columns contains further information about the individual specimen or occurence that has been observed and measured. Most of these information only apply to measured data, not literature or other derived trait data.

## Added benefit

### Facilitate data availability & Synthesis mainstreaming

Make data assembly and usage of traits widely accessible. 

Enable addressing new synthesis questions on specific taxa and across taxa

for members of the Exploratories and outside of the Exploratories

Trait-data may serve as a pilot case for data standardisation for particular types of data assessed within the exploratories. This might be transferable to other data types, as well. 

potential to expand the framework across research projects. 

### Synthesis perspectives

Comparability of traits across taxa

Gap analysis

specificity of BE trait-data is local context of exploratories, if trait data are assessed on the site, trait variation can be related to land-use intensity. In this spatial extend this would be a novelty.
