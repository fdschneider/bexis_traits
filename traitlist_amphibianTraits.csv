,Sexual dimorphism,categorical,0 = absent; 1 = present,"Difference in ornamentation (coloration) or in size (length of tail, size of head or body size) between sexes. In amphibians, females are generally bigger than males. This difference may be caused by natural selection of a large female size due to a fecundity advantage. This phenotypic difference in size is often explained by sexual selection."
Body mass,Body mass,numeric,g,"Body mass in males, females or both when sex specific data were not available."
Body mass,Adult_body mass,numeric,g,Body mass in adults without distinction between males and females in grams. This data was recorded when no sex specific data on body mass were available in the literature.
Body mass,Body mass in juveniles,numeric,g,Body mass in juveniles in grams. No distinction between sexes was available.
Body length,Snout-to-vent length in males,numeric,mm,Measurement between the snout and the vent in males (in millimeters)
Body length,Snout-to-vent length in females,numeric,mm,Measurement between the snout and the vent in females (in millimeters).
Body length,Adult snout-to-vent length,numeric,mm,"Measurement between the snout and the vent in adults, when no sex specific data were available (in millimeters)."
Body length,Total length,numeric,mm,"In Anura, this measure was similar to the snout-to-vent length. In Urodela,  this measurement takes into account the tail length."
Body length,Total length in males,numeric,mm,Measure of the total body length in males
Body length,Total length in females,numeric,mm,Measure of the total body length in females
Body length,Adult total length,numeric,mm,Measure of the total body length in adults when no sex specific data were available

Fore and hind limb proportion,Fore limb length = Hind limb length,categorical,,0: Fore limb length is not similar to hind limb length.1: Fore limb length is similar to hind limb length.
Fore and hind limb proportion,Fore limb length > Hind limb length,categorical,,0: Fore limb length is not longer than hind limb length.1: Fore limb length is longer than hind limb length.

,Presence of metatarsal tubercle,categorical,0: absent; 1: present,"Some species have a metatarsal tubercle on hind limb. A prominent inner metatarsal tubercle used for burrowing with the hind limbs. When available,  the length of the tubercle is given."
